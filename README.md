# ip-analitics
python server for analizing visits and trafic on websites

created for website traffic calculation, attacked multiple times by many bots,
fortunatly server survives and has recorded used methods to crack http servers. This was reason for project's direction change.
some android apps and free software it turned out that are part of botnet, or
they send message that this infected or vurnable phone or computer can be messed up.
server has been up with short maintenance breaks like half of year.


after ddos attack or vurnabilities of server from some regions of Asia server was down. ip-analitics v5 was already in sketchbook but it so happened that after that local vendor of internet that provides public ip and port forwarding in their hardware bans that and many other options in next update of modem firmware and update of internet contract.


programm finally registered 8 000 attempts of connection, mainly from all over the world with intent to automatic security leak detection. it was actualy passive recording visits server that looks like old apache server on windows 98, because of signature in http response. half of all visits has been scored by server at last month of project v4 exploatation.
